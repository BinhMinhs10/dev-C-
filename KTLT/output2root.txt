          I coined a new word. How do I 
             et it into the dictionary?”
    This is, by far, the question lexico
 raphers hear the most. People invent ne
 raphers decide what words to add to dic
 ine what words people actually want to 
 e? 2) Does the word have stayin  power?
                                 The usa
    e question is an important one that 
 ets at the heart of how dictionaries ar
 raphers define words or find words to a
 le of descriptivism. That is, they obse

  used, and then write definitions based
                                how thin
   s should be. While prescriptivists mi
                           ht say a slan
  term is “not a real word,” descriptivi
 raphers are very unlikely to proclaim, 
            in  an opponent in Scrabble.
      Even so, widespread usa e doesn’t

   fad? Does it fill a  ap in the lan ua

  raphers have time to write. Which brin

       et your word into the dictionary?
  Are you famous? Do you have influence?
    If you’re famous and have a followin
 , that could definitely up your chances
                                   ettin
  a word into a dictionary. Are you a wr

                    	A tale from America
 	There was once a baker who had a shop 
 ave his customers any more bread than n
 ood baker. His bread was the softest br

  for my hard work,' he said to himself.
                      	One winter mornin
 , very early, the baker was in his shop

             that came into his head. In
 	the middle of all this, he looked up a

  man wearin  an old coat. He was lookin
     at the baker's bread and he was hun

              the fresh bread and smilin

                      	A tale from Burma
 	Once there was an old man in Burma who
                                   hter.
 	He was very happy when she married a n
                    man who came from a 
          ood family. At first everythin
  went well, but after a little while th
  husband wanted to be an alchemist. He 
                      to turn dirt into 
 old. He was sure that this way they cou
     . Ni ht and day he dreamt of findin
  the secret of the alchemists. He also 
                                      to
 	find a way to make his dream come true
    wife decided to talk to her husband.
 	'Husband, why don't you try to find a

 	'But can't you see that I'm very near 
  the secret!' he replied. 'When I know 
 old, we'll be richer than you can ever 
                                   ine!'
 	Perhaps it was true that he was always
  the secret. But he never found it. Aft
  wife went to talk to her father. The f
              man the next day. 	'My dau
 hter has told me about your plans,' he 
               	in-law. 'When I was youn
 , I too wanted to be an alchemist!' The
 er man was very happy. Here, at last, w
 	who could understand his dream. The fa
                         	about the youn
  man's work, and the two of them starte
           about different ways of tryin
                      to turn dirt into 
             old. After two hours talkin
 about the thin s that an alchemist must
    	do, the old man jumped to his feet.
                 	'You've done everythin
            that I did when I was a youn
  man!' he shouted. 'I'm sure you're ver
                                    the 
 reat secret. But you need one more spec
                    to chan e dirt into 
 old, and I only learned about this a fe
             o.' 	'One more special thin
 ?' asked the son-in-law. He found talki
  with the old man more and more interes
                      . 	'Yes, that's ri
 ht. But I'm too old to do this job,' he
 	'I can do it, Father-in-law!' shouted 
                                    man.
 	'Hmm, perhaps you can,' said the old m
                is a silver powder that 
 rows on the back of the leaves of the b
                        ic powder.' 	'Ma
 ic powder?' asked the son-in-law. 'What
  	'Listen,' replied the older man. 'To 
 et this powder you must plant bananas, 
          ic words. Then when the plant 
                 rows, you'll see the ma
        ic silver powder on the leaves.'
                           	'How much ma
         ic powder do we need?' the youn
   man asked at once, very interestedly.
   	'One kilo ram,' the old man replied.
                              	'One kilo
 ram! We'll need hundreds of banana plan
 	'Yes,' said the old man, 'and that's w
           	'Don't worry!' said the youn
                      man, 'I'll do it!'

 	'Wonderful!' replied the old man. 'Now

 e were very happy for the old man, and 
 	'Now that your son has come back, your

 	But the old farmer only smiled, and re
 	People knew that the farmer was a man 
s like this. 	Life was hard in the villa

  the farmer's son left the stable door

 	Once, a poor woman from India had a so

           s. 	One mornin  she had some 
 rain to sell in the market. When she wa

                   	'Why are you shoutin

    	'She's broken our pot,' he replied.
 	'I dropped it. It was a mistake,' said
                                       .

  	After a short time, he came to a brid

        only trousers. He was shiverin .
           	'What happened?" Ravi asked.
                           	'I was comin
  to the city on my horse. Some thieves 
        on the road. They took everythin
                      - my money, shirt,

     	'Please take my horse,' said Ravi.
   	'Are you sure?' said the bride room.
   	'Yes,' said Ravi. 'I don't want it.'
      	So the bride room took the horse.
         	'You're very kind. Now we can

 	He was very happy when she married a n

           about different ways of tryin
                      to turn dirt into 
             old. After two hours talkin
 about the thin s that an alchemist must
    	do, the old man jumped to his feet.
                 	'You've done everythin
            that I did when I was a youn
  man!' he shouted. 'I'm sure you're ver

                           	'How much ma
         ic powder do we need?' the youn
